# ConnAIsseur
The art of appreciation is not spoken about a lot but certainly drives the entire concept of art. The ability to appreciate a good work of art is what even makes an art worthy of it's place in the world. ConnAIsseur is a project that would make an art based on the art collected in by the user. This would've been an herculean task had we not had NFTs. With NFTs, we hope to train a GAN model that would be inspired by the images in the users wallets and produce a unique image. We would mint the IPFS of the GAN model. The art connoisseur would have their taste of art minted in the blockchain in the form of a GAN model. 

In addition to letting the users mint a GAN model - we also want them to have the end-to-end experience of having an automated artist. For this purpose we would also use the model to geenrate a new art once ever 3 weeks and mint it into their wallet for the next year. 

The whole exeperience would be like the collector has expressed their tast to an artist and their automating the entire process of art creation. In this case the artist would be an AI model. 

## **Roadmap:**

**Pre Launch:**
- Whitelist: Since this is a premium project, we want to hand pick collectors who have a appreciation for art, and also avoid flippers. This would also help us get a list of wallets they're looking to use, as some collectors have a valut and a hot wallet. 

**On Launch Day:**
- Mint: Collectors would collect a ERC 20 token - this is the access to connAIsseur
- Generate: Collectors can now generate their ConnAIsseur when they’re ready - if they're waiting to collect more fine art before generating the model - that’s perfectly fine. If they want to go ahead right away - that’s perfect as well. If they want to use your vault account they must be a part of the whitelist - we would verify their profile.
    - A GAN model trained based on your wallet collection would be minted and stored on the IPFS
    - An image generated from your very own GAN model would be the cover of your NFT

**Post Launch Day:**
- GAN playground
- Tweak the images produced by the gan (DALLE) into your own art
- Provide copyrights for using the art generated with your model (idk why but ok?)
- Make the model auto mint art


To Do:
> Front end desgin and implementation
> Solidity for minting
